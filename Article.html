    <p>Often there is a misconception when people think about the concept of parenting, usually parenting is viewed from a perspective of a mother caring for a child. However, you find that the 21stcentury  generation of fathers are more involved and participate in their child`s life </p>
    <p>The law does not take preference on  whether a mother or a father of the child should have care or not. What is of outmost importance is the best interest of the child as enriched in the Children`s Act 38 of 2008. This may include concerns about the other parent’s ability to care for the child or if there is a history of neglect or abuse. In terms of Section 18 of the Children’s Act, a person may have either full specific parental responsibility and rights in respect of a child and these responsibilities and rights include to care for the child, to maintain contact with the child, to act as  guardian of the child and to contribute towards the maintenance of the child. The word “custody” is not used in the Children’s Act. It appears to have been replaced by the word “care”.</p>
    <p>Section 1 of the Children’s Act defines “care” which includes more than just providing a place for the child to live.  The definition of care is a broad concept which includes financial support, promoting the well-being of the child, promoting his or her rights and directing the child. Both parents have a duty and responsibility to ensure that the child has a suitable place to live and to live in conditions that are conducive to the child’s health, well-being and development. Contact on the other side is more easily compared with the previously used term “Access”. Section 1 of the Act says that “contact” means maintaining a relationship with the child. This would include communication with the child on a regular basis by visiting or being visited by the child, or other regular forms of communication including post / telephone or electronic. The father of a child automatically has full rights and responsibilities over his child. If a child`s mother denies access to a child, a father can make an application to the Court for an order granting him the rights that he has been wrongfully denied.</p>
