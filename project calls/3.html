        From the founders of the #1 site for parents of teens and young adults comes an essential
         guide for building strong relationships with your teens and preparing them to successfully launch into adulthoodThe high school and college years: an extended roller coaster of academics, friends, first loves, first break-ups, driver’s ed,
         jobs, and everything in between. Kids are constantly changing and how we parent them must change, too. But how do we stay close as
        a family as our lives move apart? Enter the co-founders of Grown and Flown, Lisa Heffernan and Mary Dell Harrington. In the midst of guiding their own kids through 
        this transition, they launched what has become the largest website and online community for parents of fifteen to twenty-five year olds. Now they’ve compiled new takeaways and fresh insights from all that they’ve learned into this handy, must-have guide.
        GROWN AND FLOWN is a one-stop resource for parenting teenagers, leading up to―and through―high school and those first years of 
        independence. It covers everything from the monumental (how to let your kids go) to the mundane (how to shop for a dorm room). 
        Organized by topic―such as academics, anxiety and mental health, college life―it features a combination of stories, advice from
         professionals, and practical sidebars.Consider this your parenting lifeline: an easy-to-use manual that offers support and perspective. GROWN AND FLOWN is required reading
         for anyone looking to raise an adult with whom you have an enduring, profound connection.</p>
